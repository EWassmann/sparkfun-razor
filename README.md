imucalibratemagdwick and magdwick.py are the real standouts in this repository, they allow you to calibrate the mpu9250 and then
saves the data to be used in magdwick.p for the magdwick sensor fusion algorithm they work quite well.
I lot track of the other files and am unsure if a lot of them work because I was trying them on an mpu9350 without magnometer (it shorted out)
and I went ovber to the bno055 IMU
