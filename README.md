imucalibratemagdwick and magdwick.py are the real standouts in this repository, they allow you to calibrate the mpu9250 and then
saves the data to be used in magdwick.p for the magdwick sensor fusion algorithm they work quite well.
I lost track of the other files and am unsure if a lot of them work because I was trying them on an mpu9350 which does not have a magnometer (it shorted out)
and I went over to the bno055 IMU
